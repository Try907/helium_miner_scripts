Script useage

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ./miner_latest.sh

Latest miner version miner-arm64_2020.07.17.0_GA

already on the latest version


This can be called from a cron or ran in a shell.

Currently it is setup to use arm64 version, but it can be easily modified to use the amd64 docker image build by modifying the ARCH variable to equal amd instead of arm.
